# Knapsack Problem
Resolution for the optimization problem known as Knapsack Problem

I used two possible solutions to solve the problem, one of them being an algorithm using dynamic programming and the other being a greedy algorithm.

For the greedy algorithm, I started sorting the elements in a way that started with the biggest value and ended with the smaller one, trying to just "shove" the elements inside the knapsack.
